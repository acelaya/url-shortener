# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## 1.15.1 - 2018-12-16

#### Added

* [#162](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/162) Added non-rest endpoints to swagger definition.

#### Changed

* [#312](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/312) Now all config files both in `php` and `json` format are loaded from `config/params` folder, easing users to provided customizations to docker image.
* [#226](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/226) Updated how table are rendered in CLI commands, making use of new features in Symfony 4.2.
* [#308](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/308) Automated docker image building.

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* [#301](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/301) Removed custom `AccessLogFactory` in favor of the implementation included in [zendframework/zend-expressive-swoole](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-swoole) v2.2.0

#### Fixed

* [#309](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/309) Added missing favicon to prevent 404 errors logged when an error page is loaded in a browser.
* [#310](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/310) Fixed execution context not being properly detected, making `CloseDbConnectionMiddlware` to be always piped. Now the check is not even made, which simplifies everything.


## 1.15.0 - 2018-12-02

#### Added

* [#208](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/208) Added initial support to run shlink using [swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/), a non-blocking IO server which improves the performance of shlink from 4 to 10 times.

    Run shlink with `./vendor/bin/zend-expressive-swoole start` to start-up the service, which will be exposed in port `8080`.

    Adding the `-d` flag, it will be started as a background service. Then you can use the `./vendor/bin/zend-expressive-swoole stop` command in order to stop it.

* [#266](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/266) Added pagination to `GET /short-urls/{shortCode}/visits` endpoint.

    In order to make it backwards compatible, it keeps returning all visits by default, but it now allows to provide the `page` and `itemsPerPage` query parameters in order to configure the number of items to get.

#### Changed

* [#267](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/267) API responses and the CLI interface is no longer translated and uses english always. Only not found error templates are still translated.
* [#289](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/289) Extracted coding standard rules to a separated package.
* [#273](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/273) Improved code coverage in repository classes.

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#278](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/278) Added missing `X-Api-Key` header to the list of valid cross domain headers.
* [#295](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/pull/295) Fixed custom slugs so that they are case sensitive and do not try to lowercase provided values.


## 1.14.1 - 2018-11-17

#### Added

* *Nothing*

#### Changed

* [#260](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/260) Increased mutation score to 65%.

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#271](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/271) Fixed memory leak produced when processing high amounts of visits at the same time.
* [#272](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/272) Fixed errors produced when trying to process visits multiple times in parallel, by using a lock which ensures only one instance is run at a time.


## 1.14.0 - 2018-11-16

#### Added

* [#236](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/236) Added option to define a redirection to a custom URL when a user hits an invalid short URL.

    It only affects URLs matched as "short URL" where the short code is invalid, not any 404 that happens in the app. For example, a request to the path `/foo/bar` will keep returning a 404.

    This new option will be asked by the installer both for new shlink installations and for any previous shlink version which is updated.

* [#189](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/189) and [#240](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/240) Added new [GeoLite2](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/)-based geolocation service which is faster and more reliable than previous one.

    It does not have API limit problems, since it uses a local database file.

    Previous service is still used as a fallback in case GeoLite DB does not contain any IP address.

#### Changed

* [#241](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/241) Fixed columns in `visit_locations` table, to be snake_case instead of camelCase.
* [#228](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/228) Updated how exceptions are serialized into logs, by using monlog's `PsrLogMessageProcessor`.
* [#225](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/225) Performance and maintainability slightly improved by enforcing via code sniffer that all global namespace classes, functions and constants are explicitly imported.
* [#196](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/196) Reduced anemic model in entities, defining more expressive public APIs instead.
* [#249](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/249) Added [functional-php](https://github.com/lstrojny/functional-php) to ease collections handling.
* [#253](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/253) Increased `user_agent` column length in `visits` table to 512.
* [#256](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/256) Updated to Infection v0.11.
* [#202](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/202) Added missing response examples to OpenAPI docs.

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

## 1.13.2 - 2018-10-18

#### Added

* [#233](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/233) Added PHP 7.3 to build matrix allowing its failure.

#### Changed

* [#235](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/235) Improved update instructions (thanks to [tivyhosting](https://github.com/tivyhosting)).

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#237](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/233) Solved errors when trying to geo-locate `null` IP addresses.

    Also improved how visitor IP addresses are discovered, thanks to [akrabat/ip-address-middleware](https://github.com/akrabat/ip-address-middleware) package.


## 1.13.1 - 2018-10-16

#### Added

* *Nothing*

#### Changed

* *Nothing*

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#231](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/197) Fixed error when processing visits.


## 1.13.0 - 2018-10-06

#### Added

* [#197](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/197) Added [cakephp/chronos](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/chronos.html) library for date manipulations.
* [#214](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/214) Improved build script, which allows builds to be done without "jumping" outside the project directory, and generates smaller dist files.

    It also allows automating the dist file generation in travis-ci builds.

* [#207](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/207) Added two new config options which are asked during installation process. The config options already existed in previous shlink version, but you had to manually set their values.

    These are the new options:

    * Visits threshold to allow short URLs to be deleted.
    * Check the visits threshold when trying to delete a short URL via REST API.

#### Changed

* [#211](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/211) Extracted installer to its own module, which will simplify moving it to a separated package in the future.
* [#200](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/200) and [#201](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/201) Renamed REST Action classes and CLI Command classes to use the concept of `ShortUrl` instead of the concept of `ShortCode` when referring to the entity, and left the `short code` concept to the identifier which is used as a unique code for a specific `Short URL`.
* [#181](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/181) When importing the configuration from a previous shlink installation, it no longer asks to import every block. Instead, it is capable of detecting only new config options introduced in the new version, and ask only for those.

    If no new options are found and you have selected to import config, no further questions will be asked and shlink will just import the old config.

#### Deprecated

* [#205](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/205) Deprecated `[POST /authenticate]` endpoint, and allowed any API request to be automatically authenticated using the `X-Api-Key` header with a valid API key.

    This effectively deprecates the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` authentication form, but it will keep working.

* As of [#200](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/200) and [#201](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/201) REST urls have changed from `/short-codes/...` to `/short-urls/...`, and the command namespaces have changed from `short-code:...` to `short-url:...`.

    In both cases, backwards compatibility has been retained and the old ones are aliases for the new ones, but the old ones are considered deprecated.

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#203](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/203) Fixed some warnings thrown while unzipping distributable files.
* [#206](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/206) An error is now thrown during installation if any required param is left empty, making the installer display a message and ask again until a value is set.


## 1.12.0 - 2018-09-15

#### Added

* [#187](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/187) Included an API endpoint and a CLI command to delete short URLs.

    Due to the implicit danger of this operation, the deletion includes a safety check. URLs cannot be deleted if they have more than a specific amount of visits.

    The visits threshold is set to **15** by default and currently it has to be manually changed. In future versions the installation/update process will ask you about the value of the visits threshold.

    In order to change it, open the `config/autoload/delete_short_urls.global.php` file, which has this structure:

    ```php
    return [

        'delete_short_urls' => [
            'visits_threshold' => 15,
            'check_visits_threshold' => true,
        ],

    ];
    ```

    Properties are self explanatory. Change `check_visits_threshold` to `false` to completely disable this safety check, and change the value of `visits_threshold` to allow short URLs with a different number of visits to be deleted.

    Once changed, delete the `data/cache/app_config.php` file (if any) to let shlink know about the new values.

    This check is implicit for the API endpoint, but can be "disabled" for the CLI command, which will ask you when trying to delete a URL which has reached to threshold in order to force the deletion.

* [#183](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/183) and [#190](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/190) Included important documentation improvements in the repository itself. You no longer need to go to the website in order to see how to install or use shlink.
* [#186](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/186) Added a small robots.txt file that prevents 404 errors to be logged due to search engines trying to index the domain where shlink is located. Thanks to [@robwent](https://github.com/robwent) for the contribution.

#### Changed

* [#145](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/145) Shlink now obfuscates IP addresses from visitors by replacing the latest octet by `0`, which does not affect geolocation and allows it to fulfil the GDPR.

    Other known services follow this same approach, like [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en) or [Matomo](https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/#step-1-automatically-anonymize-visitor-ips)

* [#182](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/182) The short URL creation API endpoints now return the same model used for lists and details endpoints.

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#188](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/188) Shlink now allows multiple short URLs to be created that resolve to the same long URL.


## 1.11.0 - 2018-08-13

#### Added

* [#170](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/170) and [#171](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/171) Updated `[GET /short-codes]` and `[GET /short-codes/{shortCode}]` endpoints to return more meaningful information and make their response consistent.

    The short URLs are now represented by this object in both cases:

    ```json
    {
        "shortCode": "12Kb3",
        "shortUrl": "https://doma.in/12Kb3",
        "longUrl": "https://shlink.io",
        "dateCreated": "2016-05-01T20:34:16+02:00",
        "visitsCount": 1029,
        "tags": [
            "shlink"
        ],
        "originalUrl": "https://shlink.io"
    }
    ```

    The `originalUrl` property is considered deprecated and has been kept for backward compatibility purposes. It holds the same value as the `longUrl` property.

#### Changed

* *Nothing*

#### Deprecated

* The `originalUrl` property in `[GET /short-codes]` and `[GET /short-codes/{shortCode}]` endpoints is now deprecated and replaced by the `longUrl` property.

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* *Nothing*


## 1.10.2 - 2018-08-04

#### Added

* *Nothing*

#### Changed

* *Nothing*

#### Deprecated

* *Nothing*

#### Removed

* *Nothing*

#### Fixed

* [#177](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/177) Fixed `[GET] /short-codes` endpoint returning a 500 status code when trying to filter by `tags` and `searchTerm` at the same time.
* [#175](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/175) Fixed error introduced in previous version, where you could end up banned from the service used to resolve IP address locations.

    In order to fix that, just fill [this form](http://ip-api.com/docs/unban) including your server's IP address and your server should be unbanned.
    
    In order to prevent this, after resolving 150 IP addresses, shlink now waits 1 minute before trying to resolve any more addresses.


## 1.10.1 - 2018-08-02

#### Added

* *Nothing*

#### Changed

* [#167](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/167) Shlink version is now set at build time to avoid older version numbers to be kept in newer builds.

* [#174](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/174) Fixed geolocation not working due to a deprecation on used service.
* [#172](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/172) Documented missing filtering params for `[GET] /short-codes/{shortCode}/visits` API endpoint, which allow the list to be filtered by date range.

    For example: `https://doma.in/rest/v1/short-urls/abc123/visits?startDate=2017-05-23&endDate=2017-10-05`

* [#169](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/169) Fixed unhandled error when parsing `ShortUrlMeta` and date fields are already `DateTime` instances.


## 1.10.0 - 2018-07-09

#### Added

* [#161](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/161) AddED support for shlink to be run with [swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) via [zend-expressive-swoole](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-swoole) package

    * Old structure:
    
    ```json
    {
      "pagination": {
        "currentPage": 1,
        "pagesCount": 2
      }
    }
    ```
    
    * New structure:
    
    ```json
    {
      "pagination": {
        "currentPage": 2,
        "pagesCount": 13,
        "itemsPerPage": 10,
        "itemsInCurrentPage": 10,

## 1.9.0 - 2018-05-07

#### Added

* [#147](https://github.com/shlinkio/shlink/issues/147) Allowed short URLs to be created on the fly using a single API request, including the API key in a  query param.

    This eases integration with third party services.
    
    With this feature, a simple request to a URL like `https://doma.in/rest/v1/short-codes/shorten?apiKey=[YOUR_API_KEY]&longUrl=[URL_TO_BE_SHORTENED]` would return the shortened one in JSON or plain text format.
